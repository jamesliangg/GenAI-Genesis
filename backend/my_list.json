Our plan to create a new kind of health care for a healthier community means advancing health across the hospital, the system and the community and is built on an inter-connected system of care organized around patients and leaving no one behind. Recognizing this mission could not be realized without also assessing and investing in our internal practices, culture and processes we are building an organization where everyone at THP feels they belong, their voice matters, and contributes to our collective success. We commit to making systemic fairness a reality for all and are working to ensure that the community we serve is reflected at all levels, and in all professions at THP. Diversity is our strength and we recognize and value teaching and learning we all contribute and benefit from in our environment; our unique lived experiences matter and shape our actions and behaviors. In becoming an antiracist organization, we acknowledge the existence of oppression, racism, bias and complicity, and we have been working steadily to make changes in the way we work to dismantle these barriers. This includes developing and realizing an action plan to advance racial equity and embed anti-racism accountability across IBH, starting with our anti-Black racism priority initiative.\n  \n\n\nOur Commitment to and Progress Towards Anti-Black Racism\n THP and IBH have made a commitment to becoming a safer and more inclusive environment with a dedicated focus on dismantling anti-Black racism and white supremacy at THP. This commitment is in response to the recognition that Black people systemically experience the organization differently than their white and non-Black colleagues. Similarly, Black scientists and research staff experience the research ecosystem differently. Anti-Black racism is the starting point as Black individuals and communities are disproportionately impacted by the harms of systemic racism and white supremacy culture. In this work, we are committed to disrupting and reconstructing the processes, practices, and systems that contribute to anti-Black racism.\n\n THP established its Equity Secretariat Office in 2020, providing education and training on anti-Black racism, and establishing a THP Circle on Anti-Racism and Inclusion. Today, the Equity Secretariat has become the Equity, Anti-Racism and Inclusion Office, with a current staff of four whose specific focus is on dismantling anti-Black racism and white supremacy and advancing other dimensions of inequity within THP. This office supported the completion of an externally-led Anti-Black Racism Climate Review and resulting report, which includes recommendations and actions that are being integrated into THP\u2019s operating plan. At IBH, the Anti-Black Racism Allyship Initiative (ABRAI) was established in 2020 to understand the experiences of Black staff within IBH and develop an action plan in partnership with Black staff to address anti-Black racism. The action plan has been translated into operational objectives that support the recruitment, retention, and career development of Black staff. As part of this plan, IBH has established an optional, monthly Black Excellence meeting for Black staff at IBH where the purpose is to provide a safe space where all hold power and attendees can connect, network, and support each other.\n\n Trillium Health Partners is an equal opportunity employer committed to fostering a healthy, safe and respectful environment for healing, based on our values compassion, excellence and courage. To be Better Together, we commit to fostering a respectful workplace culture that promotes a safe and supportive environment for everyone who provides care, supports caregiving, receives care or visits the hospital.\n\n To pursue this career opportunity, please visit our website: www.trilliumhealthpartners.ca\n\n\n Candidates are selected on the basis of their skill, ability, experience and qualifications.\n\n\n Where these factors are relatively equal seniority shall govern providing the successful applicant.\n\n\n\n Trillium Health Partners\u2019 (THP) is an equal opportunity employer who values the importance of antiracism work and is committed to integrating antiracism, diversity, equity and inclusion best practices throughout THP operations, policies and culture.

We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community, and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.\n \n The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society. However, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, always.\n  Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.\n \n The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.\n \n We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of electronics, deep tech., software, design, advanced manufacturing, and data science.\n \n Responsibilities\n\n Develop, test and debug firmware for our core Skiin product\n Write drivers for various MCUs and peripherals\n Integrate wireless communication protocols (BLE, Wi-Fi, Cellular etc.)\n Contribute to automated regression test suite\n Optimize firmware for low-power operation\n Contribute to the design of system architecture\n Write and maintain project documentation\n Do PCB bring-up, testing, debugging and solving complex multi-disciplinary issues\n Write PC software to create testers, visualizers and data loggers\n Work closely with the hardware, software, mechanical and textile teams to fulfill project requirements\n Qualifications Required\n\n BASc. in Electrical/Computer Engineering, Computer Science or related fields\n 2+ years experience developing firmware for embedded systems\n Proficiency in C/C++ programming languages\n Proficiency in Python\n Experience working on the hardware/software interfaces\n Experience deploying embedded software for real products\n Development of bare metal and RTOS based firmware\n Advanced knowledge of C language\n Advanced knowledge of Python, C++ or another high level programming language\n Strong Object Oriented Programming and Software Engineering foundations\n Experience developing low-level communication drivers (SPI, UART, I2C, USB, etc.)\n Comfortable with board bring-up, schematics interpretation and equipment such as oscilloscopes, multimeters, etc\n Comfortable working in a start-up environment\n Nice to have\n\n Familiarity working with Zephyr and/or FreeRTOS\n Experience with BLE, Wi-Fi or Cellular communication protocols\n Knowledge of signal processing and machine learning algorithms\n Knowledge of software design patterns\n Knowledge of ISO 13485 and/or IEC 62304\n Experience in biometric sensing or actuation (ECG/EMG/EEG)\n Experience building bootloaders and production test firmware\n What You Bring to the Team\n\n Excellent communication, interpersonal, and presentation skills\n The ability to collaborate seamlessly within a cross-disciplinary team environment\n Strong attention to detail\n\n  What we offer at Myant:\n\n Employee stock options\n Paid Sick Days and Floating Days\n Group Health Insurance Plan\n RRSP matching Plan\n Corporate Events\n Exposure working in one of the most innovative and forward-thinking tech companies.\n\n  Myant is a diversified, equal opportunity employer.

We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community, and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.\n \n The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society. However, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, always.\n  Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.\n \n The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.\n \n We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of electronics, deep tech., software, design, advanced manufacturing, and data science.\n \n Role\n\n As a Software QA Lead at Myant, you'll play a pivotal role in ensuring the quality and reliability of our software solutions.
